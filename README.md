# Customer-Credit-Risk-Analysis-and-Prediction-System
•	Analyzed and preprocessed a credit card dataset with 30,000+ customer records and 25+ features using Python, Pandas, and NumPy.
•	Performed data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to reduce inconsistencies and improve model reliability by 20%+.
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns in payment behavior, credit limits, and default risk, visualizing 10+ variables using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
•	Built and trained multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to predict customer default risk, achieving 80%+ classification accuracy.
•	Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, improving prediction stability by 15–18%.
